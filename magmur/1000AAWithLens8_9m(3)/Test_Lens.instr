* Instrument: Test_Lens
*
* %Identification
* Written by: E. Farhi/C. Monzat
* Date: Dec 2009.
* Origin: ILL
* %INSTRUMENT_SITE: Tests_optics
*
* Demonstrate focusing effect of refractive lenses
*
* %Description
*
* Very simple setup with 30 stacked lenses which focus a cold neutron,
* non diverging beam (ideal case). A set of PSD monitors is positioned
* around the focusing point to show the beam spot.
*
* %Parameters
* lambda: [Angs]     Source wavelength
* position_PSD: [m]  Distance from last lens to first monitor
*
* %Link
